1. sketch.py => File read and write example.
2. sketch1.py => Extension to sketch.py but locals() is used to check whether a given data is initialized
	  in a given context or not
3. sketch2.py => Usage of "open with " to avoid the finally block and file closing. Also extends nester_new.py which has now 
	ability the print a list not only to standard out but also to a file.
4. sketch3.py => Writing in bytes to a file. Kind of serialization and de-serialization.
